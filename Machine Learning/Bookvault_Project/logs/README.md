# Logs Directory

This directory stores application logs generated by the BookVault application.

Log files are automatically created by the logging system and rotated based on configuration.

## Log Files

- Application logs: Timestamped log files with INFO, WARNING, ERROR levels
- Debug logs: Detailed debugging information when LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

## Note

Log files (*.log) are excluded from git via .gitignore but the directory structure is preserved.
